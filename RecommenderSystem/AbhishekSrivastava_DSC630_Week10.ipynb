    "### 1. **Understanding the Task and Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The goal is to recommend movies to a user based on a movie they say they like.\n",
    "- The underlying data contains movies, their titles, and their genres, but no user ratings or explicit feedback.\n",
    "- The chosen recommendation method is **content-based filtering**, which means recommendations are generated by comparing the content (genres) of the user-selected movie with all others in the database.[1][2]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Preparing the Movie Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The movie data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame from an Excel sheet.\n",
    "- Each movie’s `genres` column (example: `Comedy|Romance`) is transformed into a Python set (example: `{\"Comedy\", \"Romance\"}`).\n",
    "    - This allows easy comparison for overlap between genre sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Getting Input From the User**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code asks the user to enter the title of a movie they like using the command line.\n",
    "- It prints some sample movie titles first to make it easier for the user to select correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Finding the Selected Movie’s Genres**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The system searches the DataFrame for the row whose title matches the user's input.\n",
    "- It extracts the set of genres for that movie:\n",
    "  - For example, if the user picks `\"Toy Story (1995)\"`, the genre set is `{\"Adventure\", \"Animation\", \"Children\", \"Comedy\", \"Fantasy\"}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Computing Genre Similarity**\n",
    "\n",
    "- For every other movie in the database:\n",
    "    - The program compares its genre set with the selected movie’s genre set.\n",
    "    - Similarity is computed by counting the number of genres in common (the intersection of the two sets).\n",
    "    - The more genres two movies share, the higher their similarity score.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Sorting and Selecting Recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- All movies (except the one chosen by the user) are ranked by their similarity score.\n",
    "- The top ten movies with the most genre overlap with the user-selected movie are chosen as recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Displaying Recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code prints the recommended movies, their genres, and their similarity score (number of overlapping genres) for the user to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Summary of Steps Performed**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load and Process Data:** Prepare movies and genres for comparison.\n",
    "2. **User Input:** Ask the user to select a movie.\n",
    "3. **Extract Chosen Movie's Genres:** Find out which genres that movie belongs to.\n",
    "4. **Compute Genre Overlap:** Compare every movie’s genres to the chosen movie’s genres.\n",
    "5. **Sort and Recommend:** Find and display the ten most similar movies by genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Method Reference**\n",
    "This process is called **content-based filtering**, a well-established recommendation technique for situations where you have item features (like genres), but you don’t have extensive user data or ratings.[2][1]\n",
