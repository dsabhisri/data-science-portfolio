      "1. **Clear Relationships**: Our data has clear relationships where customers are associated with multiple orders. PostgreSQL is a relational database that excels at handling such relationships efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complex Queries**: We needed to perform complex queries for generating analytics reports and extracting insights from our data. PostgreSQL is known for its powerful query capabilities, making it a suitable choice for our use case.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Transactions**: Transactions are critical for us, especially in scenarios like payment processing where data consistency is crucial. PostgreSQL provides strong support for transactions, ensuring data integrity and consistency.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Team Familiarity**: Our team already has expertise in SQL, which is the query language used by PostgreSQL. This familiarity with SQL made it easier for our team to work with PostgreSQL effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "While MongoDB is indeed more modern and flexible with its document-based approach and support for flexible schemas, we prioritized data relationships, complex queries, and transaction support for our specific requirements. By choosing PostgreSQL, we accepted the trade-off of giving up some flexibility in schema design in favor of strong consistency, relational capabilities, and transaction support.\n"

    "1. PostgreSQL (Relational Database)\n",
    "   ✓ Good at: Relationships between data (customers → orders)\n",
    "   ✓ Good at: Complex queries (find all customers who ordered in last 30 days)\n",
    "   ✓ Good at: Transactions (order + payment must succeed together)\n",
    "   ✗ Bad at: Flexible schemas (adding fields requires migrations)\n",
    "   Cost: Free (open source)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. MongoDB (Document Database)\n",
    "   ✓ Good at: Flexible schemas (easy to add new fields)\n",
    "   ✓ Good at: Storing complex nested data\n",
    "   ✗ Bad at: Relationships across collections\n",
    "   ✗ Bad at: Complex transactions (weaker than PostgreSQL)\n",
    "   Cost: Free (open source) but more memory needed\n",
    "\n",
    "3. DynamoDB (AWS Managed NoSQL)\n",
    "   ✓ Good at: Scaling automatically\n",
    "   ✓ Good at: Simple key lookups\n",
    "   ✗ Bad at: Complex queries (need to design around limitations)\n",
    "   ✗ Bad at: Cost (expensive at scale)\n",

      "Our process_orders.py script keeps crashing with \"MemoryError: unable to allocate array\".\n",
      "It works with small data but fails on production data. What's wrong?\n",
      "\n",
      "🤖 ANSWER:\n",
      "The issue with the `calculate_daily_totals` function in the `process_orders.py` script is that it loads all orders into memory at once using the `collect()` method. This approach is not efficient and leads to memory errors when processing a large amount of data.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address this issue and prevent memory errors, you can follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Identify the Problem**:\n",
      "   - Loading all orders into memory at once is causing memory errors.\n",
      "   - The script works fine with small data but crashes with production data.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Debugging Steps**:\n",
      "   - Check memory usage to see if the process is consuming a large amount of RAM.\n",
      "   - Check the amount of data being processed to identify if it exceeds the system's capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Fix Approaches**:\n",
      "   - **Option A - Use SQL Aggregation**:\n",
      "     - Instead of loading all data into memory, perform the aggregation directly in the database using SQL queries.\n",
      "     - This approach offloads the processing work to the database, which is more efficient for large datasets.\n",
      "  \n",
      "   - **Option B - Process in Batches**:\n",
      "     - Process the data in smaller batches instead of loading everything at once.\n",
      "     - You can chunk the data into manageable sizes and process each batch separately to avoid memory issues.\n",
      "  \n",
      "   - **Option C - Upgrade Server RAM**:\n",
      "     - Increasing the server's RAM may temporarily alleviate the issue, but it's not a recommended solution.\n",
      "     - It's better to optimize the code first before considering hardware upgrades.\n",
      "\n",
      "By implementing either Option A (SQL aggregation) or Option B (processing in batches), you can improve the efficiency of the script and avoid memory errors when processing large datasets.\n"

    "        date = order['order_date']\n",

    "SYSTEM CONFIGURATION:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Server RAM: 8 GB\n",
    "- Database: 5 million orders\n",
    "- Typical query: Processes 100,000 orders (about 2 GB of data)\n",
    "\n",
    "KNOWN ISSUES:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. collect() loads ALL data into memory\n",
    "   - Works fine with 10,000 orders (200 MB)\n",
    "   - Crashes with 100,000+ orders (2+ GB)\n",
    "   - Python dict operations slow on huge datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Processing row-by-row is inefficient\n",
    "   - Better to use SQL aggregation (database does the work)\n",
    "   - Better to process in batches (chunk the data)\n",
    "\n",
    "DEBUGGING STEPS:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check memory usage\n",
    "   - Run: htop or top command\n",
    "   - Look for process using >80% RAM\n",
    "   - Check if process gets \"Killed\" (out of memory error)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Check how much data you're processing\n",
    "   - Add: print(f\"Processing {orders_df.count()} orders\")\n",
    "   - If >50,000 orders, memory issues likely\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Fix approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "   OPTION A - Use SQL aggregation (best):\n",
    "   query = '''\n",
    "       SELECT order_date, SUM(total_amount) as daily_total\n",
    "       FROM orders\n",
    "       GROUP BY order_date\n",
    "   '''\n",
    "   result = database.execute(query)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   OPTION B - Process in batches:\n",
    "   for batch in orders_df.to_batches(size=10000):\n",
    "       process_batch(batch)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   OPTION C - Add more RAM:\n",
    "   Upgrade server from 8GB → 16GB\n",
    "   (Not recommended - fix code first!)\n",
